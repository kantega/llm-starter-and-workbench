#### Markdown view

Shows markdown, e.g. documentation for a view (like this one).
The markdown is rendered using the MarkdownView control from [jpro-mdfx](https://github.com/JPro-one/JPro-Platform/tree/main/jpro-mdfx),
which uses the [flexmark-java library](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java), see respective documentation for details.

You can follow links to other markdown files and navigate backward and forward using entries in the context menu.

NYI: Other links are opened in an external browser.
